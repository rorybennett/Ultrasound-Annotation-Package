### Extras

Just some extra scripts for some niche work, beyond what they were used for 
there is probably no use in these anymore:
1. `convert_to_pixel.py`: Convert all data from mm to pixel coordinates.
2. `import_multi_segmentation.py`: Convert PointData.txt to PointData.json, not sure why it has this name.
3. `mass_save.py`: Add extra files to IPV data so that they can be opened in this application.
4. `repair_bullet_data.py`: Fix bullet data, at some point a change must have been made.
5. `repair_data_png.py`: Repair data.txt file by removing .png from frame names.

Keeping these purely for sentimental reasons.
