### Classes
Classes used in this application. Pretty sure this is not how "Best Practices" would
organise things, but it is one step up from using a single file for the entire application:
1. ErrorDialog.py: Dialog for displaying errors.
2. Export.py: Exporting class.
3. ExportDialogs.py: Dialogs used by the Export class.
4. FrameCanvas.py: Custom canvas used for displaying and interacting with frames.
5. Scan.py: Scan object class.
6. ScanUtil.py: Utility functions for the Scan class.
7. Utils.py: Utilities used through the application.
